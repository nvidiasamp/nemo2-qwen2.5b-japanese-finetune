    "# Optimizing Hugging Face Models with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo 2.0 enables users to perform Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) using Hugging Face (HF) Large Language Models (LLMs). It utilizes HF's auto classes to download and load transformer models, and wraps these models as Lightning modules to execute tasks like SFT and PEFT. The goal of this feature is to provide day-0 support for the models available in HF.\n",
    "\n",
    "[AutoModel](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto) is the generic model class that is instantiated as one of the model classes from the library when created with the from_pretrained() class method. There are many AutoModel classes in HF, each covering a specific group of transformer model architectures. The AutoModel class primarily loads the base transformer model that converts embeddings to hidden states. For example, a specific AutoModel class like AutoModelForCausalLM includes a causal language modeling head on top of the base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "NeMo 2.0 includes wrapper classes for these HF AutoModel classes, making them runnable in NeMo pretraining, SFT, and PEFT workflows by converting them into Lightning modules. Due to the large number of AutoModel classes, NeMo 2.0 currently includes only the widely used auto classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate a SFT training example on how to perform SFT with Hugging Face LLMs to make the models more performant on a specific task. We will focus on the models that can be loaded using the HF's `AutoModelForCausalLM` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='red'>NOTE:</font> Due to the limitations of the Jupyter Notebook, the example in this notebook works only on a single GPU. However, if you move the code to a script, you can run it on multiple GPUs. If you are interested in running a multi-GPU example using the Jupyter Notebook, please check the SFT example in NeMo-Run."
